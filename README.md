## File information
**/stock-risk-analyzer**
For our risk analysis we used the Stock Risk Analyzer which is an open-source application designed to help investors, traders, and financial analysts assess the risk levels of stocks using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data and technical indicators, the application classifies stocks into risk categories (Low, Medium, High), providing users with valuable insights to make informed investment decisions.
